# Privacy Policy for Twitch Highlighter

**Twitch Highlighter** does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data.

The extension runs entirely on the user’s device and only modifies the appearance of Twitch chat messages (highlighting moderators, VIPs, and verified users).

No information is sent to external servers, and no analytics or tracking mechanisms are used.

If you have any questions, please contact the developer.
